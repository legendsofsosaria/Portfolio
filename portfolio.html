        <h1>Scorpio - 2D Shooter Game Built From Scratch</h1>
        <p>
            The first video showcases my ability to design and program a game from scratch. This was a final project
            for a game development course I took at George Brown College. I used SDL and C++ to create this game with a
            partner. The game showcases the ability to implement game development skills such as collision detection and
            a basic AI.

        <h1>Custom Features Developed for Ultima Online</h1>
        <p>
            The remaining videos showcase some of the custom systems and features I have conceptualized, designed, and
            programmed for Ultima Online, a classic multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG). The features
            displayed demonstrate my skills in game development, including systems programming, UI design, and
            creating engaging mechanics that enhance player interaction and immersion.
            Tools Used: C#, CentrED# (for mapping), UOFiddler (software for editing client files), VitaNex API's and ServUO emulator.
            Here are some highlights of the custom systems I developed:
        </p>
        <h2>Diving System:</h2>
        <p>
            I created a custom diving system that allows players to travel underwater. This system involved designing a terrain
            for underwater travel, creating animations for water bubbles, and implementing a drowning mechanic that is prevented by
            equipping a scuba mask.
        </p>

        <h2>Seed Machine:</h2>
        <p>
            I designed and implemented a seed machine that processes crops into seeds. The machine has a 2-minute processing time
            per crop, and I implemented a timer to manage this. The custom UI updates every 2 minutes with a refreshed gump
            (player interface), allowing players to track the remaining time for each crop.
        </p>

        <h2>Harvesting System:</h2>
        <p>
            This system allows players to plant and harvest crops in public fields or on their house plots. A unique challenge
            was preventing crops from being left behind when playersâ€™ houses decayed. Additionally, crops in public fields can
            be picked by other players after 8 days of inaction.
        </p>

        <h2>Necromancy Domination System:</h2>
        <p>
            I created a Necromancy Domination system, allowing players to control undead creatures. This system required client-side
            edits for custom tooltips and enabling necromancy as an "active" skill. Additionally, the creature's behavior is affected
            by the player's karma, and a positive karma player cannot control the pet until their karma goes negative.
        </p>
        <h2>Monsters Projectiles:</h2>
        <p>
            I created hundreds of custom monsters, including Earth Titans that throw projectiles. Giants (Fire, Frost, Storm, Stone)
            each use a unique projectile with corresponding damage types, such as fireballs, ice chunks, lightning, and boulders.
        </p>
        <h2>Auto Blood Vial:</h2>
        <p>
            This showcases a quest item I programmed, designed by another staff member. The Auto Blood Vial draws blood from
            a monster but causes it to explode afterward. I utilized built-in VitaNex effects for this functionality.
        </p>
        <h2>Sunless Citadel Dungeon:</h2>
        <p>
            In this project, I programmed all the monsters, quests, items, and systems for a custom dungeon built by one of our
            developers. The dungeon includes intricate systems and unique mechanics, developed based on detailed notes from the
            designer.
        </p>
        <h2>Archaeology Museum:</h2>
        <p>
            I designed and mapped this dungeon, also programming all the monsters, quests, items, and systems. One key feature is
            the archaeology system, where players use tools to dig and uncover items. The dungeon features puzzles and traps,
            including a complex lever puzzle and a boulder trap that drops from the ceiling.
        </p>

        <h2>Achievement System:</h2>
        <p>
            I designed and implemented this achievement system, which rewards players for completing tasks and keeps track of
            their progress. Players can view their achievements, as well as others' achievements, using in-game commands. A
            complex part of the system was the daily login reward, which resets after 24 hours of inactivity.

        <h1>Web Development</h1>

        <h2>Portfolio Website (This site)</h2>
        <p>
            This portfolio site was built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as both a showcase
            of my work and a demonstration of my web development skills. The site is fully responsive and was designed
            to provide a seamless user experience across devices. I also created a fully-functional web form on the contact
            page that will submit an email to contact me using JavaScript and EmailJS.

        <h2>Web Development Class Final Project: <a href="https://legendsofsosaria.github.io/Web-Design/">Art & Pastry Website</a></h2>
        <p>
            For my final project in my web development class, I built a portfolio site for a bakery.
            This project was focused on implementing modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            I implemented a responsive layout to make the site functional and user-friendly. I also implemented some
            cool features with JavaScript such as a slideshow, modal boxes from my gallery grid, and an order form.
            Unlike the form on this portfolio website, the form on this site just redirects you to a page saying it
            is submitted as the website was for a business that is no longer operational.
